This project aims to pull my freebusy data from the Google Calendar API to determine when I have free time. Then, it will take in an input from the user corresponding to the tasks that he/she has to do, and their respective priority, duration, and difficulty. From there, it generates an importance index that is used to organize the to-do list, which will then be slotted into the free time pulled from the Google Calendar API.

The purpose of this project is, aside from creating an efficient task prioritizing system for myself, to learn git and general version control concepts. So, I apologize for some confusing commits and merge requests. I would appreciate any feedback, as I am still learning.
